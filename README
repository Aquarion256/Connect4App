In one of my previous projects I made a Connect 4 AI in C++. However it utilised the input window for all of it's functions,
Which is pretty unsightly and annoying to work with.

So I decided to switch over to Python and made a GUI using kivy.
This was amazing to work with. Kivy has a really easy to use library and the use of a .kv file makes things so neat and easy.

I think this will be the end of my Connect 4 saga however. It was fun to always use the new skills I learnt to 
add to this project, but I think the concept will grow old o my profile.
